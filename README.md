# üè† House Facade Direction Dataset Generator

This project aims to automatically generate a structured dataset of houses, their windows and balconies, and label them with their corresponding **cardinal direction** (e.g., North, East) based on the compass present in architectural schema files (usually in PDF format).

The pipeline leverages a combination of object detection (YOLO) and deep learning (ResNet18) to extract relevant visual information and assign directional labels.

## üìÅ Project Overview

The dataset generation pipeline is divided into **three main stages**:

### 1. Detecting Schema and Compass from PDF

- Input: PDF architectural files (converted to JPG during preprocessing).
- Train [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) for object detection:
  - The **inner schema** area.
  - The **outside schema** area (major samples of the data have several floors in one file and not living areas are not in the scope of interes).
  - The **compass** area, indicating directions (usually a North arrow).
- Outputs: Cropped schema and compass images.

### 2. Detecting Windows and Balconies

- Another [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)* is applied to the **cropped schema** to detect:
  - **Windows in** (windows inside of the living area).
  - **Windows out** (the rest).
  - **Balconies**.
- The bounding boxes of these elements are extracted for directional labeling.

### 3. Estimating Compass Orientation with ResNet18

- A **ResNet18** classification model is trained to predict the **North direction** and **Compass center** on the cropped compass image.
- Build 8 axis (North, North-West, South-West, etc.)
- The predicted direction is projected onto the building schema.
- Each detected **Window in** and **Balcony** is assigned a direction label based on its position relative to the estimated North.

## üì¶ Output

- A labeled dataset of building elements (windows, balconies) with direction tags (`N`, `NE`, `E`, `SE`, `S`, `SW`, `W`, `NW`).
